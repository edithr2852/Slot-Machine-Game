## Game Overview
#### Cyber Slots is your average casino slot machine game. The twist is, that its theme is inspired by a video game called Cyberpunk 2077. When you press the spin button and three of the same symbols line up, you win the jackpot. You can try your luck at a casino game, right at home. It's that easy.

## Next steps 
#### 1. I will be adding a betting function which will give you the ability to lose your money or win a lot of money. 
#### 2. I will also implement new levels of winning as a new game function, for example, if you get three of the same symbols you win small but if you get three jackpot images you win big!
